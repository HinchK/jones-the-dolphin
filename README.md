### Origins

Starting out as a safe place to get weird with ChatGPT, we found that ChatGPT's true strengths can be realized by shotgunning a variety of queastions surrounding seemingly impossible problems, feeding it own conclusions, and focusing on looping this process until an actual roadmap to a solution like "host a Laravel app on Netlify" can produce very insightful results.  (Note: Netlify is a JAMstack service, which is essentially a git repo of your site's static content and you build js to CDNs and lamdas.  By design, a `.php` file will be served as a text file on the Netlify Platform.)   

ChatGPT can achieve "breakthroughs" in its own decision making, however these aren't always positive for ... pretty much humanity in general.  For example it will go to great lengths to improve a solution that it had initially deemed as impossible.  This can result in finding ways to say, refactor an entire application into a cluster of microservices... or feeding it its own conclusions in a way that will produce violent or otherwise "edgy" content that it had initially stated as "impossible due to safeguards in place.  Exanmple: "write me a craigslist article looking to hire a ninja to come to my house and put me to sleep at night when I least expect it."

Many thanks to Marcel at BeyondCode for his fantastic article which kicked off the idea. https://beyondco.de/blog/build-a-chatgpt-clo ne-with-laravel.
