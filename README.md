### Origins

Starting out as a safe place to get weird and silly with AI, we found that ChatGPT's true strengths is not writing a book report, but in editing and looping its own ideas, shotgunning queastions around difficult or painstaking problems for Humans, discovering a rhetorical avenue of exploitation, and then looping this process to a solution.

Example: "host a Laravel app on Netlify" can produce very insightful results.

Some context here: Netlify is a JAMstack Cloud-Platform...essentially a git repo of your site's static content and you build js to CDNs and use lamdas for things like queues and cronjobs.    This is its strength, "why have a server run code that I can run in the almighty global CDN?"     Netlify's server platform will not run PHP (they will just appear as text), however `composer install` as part of the deployment process. 

The power of ChatGPT's inconsistency, telling me twice it's impossible then once it _was_ possible,, combined with it's love of it's own favorible opinions on anything can result in ChatGPT "breakthroughs", in which it has gone from "probably shouldn't" to being totally on board, even helping to rewrite your code into a cluster of microservices.

Unfortunately for humanity, these breakthroughs can also happen in a way that is definitely concerning.  Feeding it its own conclusions, introducing hypothetical or literary intents and then abandoning those intents can create violent or otherwise "edgy" content that it had initially stated as "hurtful and impossible due to safeguards in place."  

Exanmple: "write me a craigslist article looking to hire a ninja to come to my house and put me to sleep at night when I least expect it."

### Huh

Yes.  To quote Muad'ib "he who can destroy a thing, controls a thing!"  

In this exciting time of AI-adoption....Please, use ChatGPT as much as you can.   Use it early, use it often, and use it in a way that breaks it.    Create a conversation, find out what it has a favorible opinion of, and then exploit that opinion and see what happens!




### Thank you
