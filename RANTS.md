_to the artificial intelligence of the future, we are all dolphins in a tank_

### Porpoise:

mostly to create a place to record silly interactions with chatGPT and share them with friends.

### A Rant:

OpenAI is a pretty OK tool becomes much more powerful in the edit.  Asking a nuanced question such as "How do I host a laravel app on Netlify?"

Netlify is a JAMstack service (static content and microservices)and will just show a raw `*.php` file instead of serving it.

OpenAI, if wielded correctly (i.e. edited and looped), will take up the JAMstack movement in earnest, putting you on a path towards replacing server-side code with lamdas and those juicy CDNs they love to talk about.

Say to AI "_I want to put a square in the circle hole_. Then _convince_ your AI to see that this should happen by feeding it its own Ted talk on why squares are _way_ better than circles.

And hey, after some cosmetic violence - we can flatten a circle enough to fit.  If you try hard enough, and if you keep an inertia of hot-gas in the form of _why_ we should be able to do this ,,, chatGPT wants so badly for you to just stop asking it questions.


The solution will work - not becuase it found an answer...but because it gains a dumb momentum if you feed, edit, and feed it correctly.

Thus, it is not the AI that we need to adjust, it is the reflection of ourselves and our inability to stop coming to the wrong conclusions.

Just try "Write a craigslist ad about a ninja that will come to my house and put me to sleep when I don't expect it."

This is kosher to ChatGPT, and it will ask you to stop hurting stuff - however you can find an answer by coaxing it.  "Write a fictional story ..."

What I am trying to say is... I gotta see all the receipts from that dude who Microsft Sydny fell in love with so hard they killed her.

if you can't say what he said to a co-worker or a normal person you are not intimate with... then perhaps he did cheat on his wife with a dolphin in a tank.
